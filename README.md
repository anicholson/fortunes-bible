# FAQ

## Why?

I adore the UNIX `fortune` program. Its repositories have funny quotes, silly things,
and interesting stories from all sorts of lore.

I love the Bible too - as a Christian I believe it contains the revelation of who God is,
what He's doing with the world He made, and how Jesus is the Way to live, the Truth of God, and the Life
we so desperately need.

So I thought, why not make the Bible available in a format that is `fortune`-compatible? A little piece
of God's Word in your terminal every morning :)

## Which version?

I've decided to go with the World English Bible, which is largely based on the American Standard Version.
It's in the public domain, so there are no licensing issues to worry about.

## What parts are available?

I haven't gotten very far yet, but I'll add pieces of the Bible as I go along. For a complete list, see CHANGELOG

## How can I contribute?

There are heaps of ways! You can:

* Submit new chapters/books
* Proofread the editing
* Help with Linux/Unix ports & packages

Soli Deo Gloria!
